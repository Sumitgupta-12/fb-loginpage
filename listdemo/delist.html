        A computer network is a set of devices connected through links. A node
        can be computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or
        receiving the data. The links connecting the nodes are known as
        communication channels.

        DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS is a directory service that
        provides a mapping between the name of a host on the network and its
        numerical address. DNS is required for the functioning of the internet.
        Each node in a tree has a domain name, and a full domain name is a

      <dd>
        OSI stands for Open System Interconnection is a reference model that
        describes how information from a software application in one computer
        moves through a physical medium to the software application in another
        computer. OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a
        particular network function. OSI model was developed by the
        International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984, and it is
        now considered as an architectural model for the inter-computer
        communications.
